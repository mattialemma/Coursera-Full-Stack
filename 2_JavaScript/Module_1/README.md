Introduction to JavaScript

In this part of the course, we started exploring the basics of JavaScript, performing tests both on Visual Studio Code and through the DevTools console of the Google Chrome browser.

The following were introduced and experimented with:

Using console.log and the DevTools tool.
The fundamentals of conditional logic
Switch structures
Using variables
The main loops (cycles)
The fundamental syntax rules of the language

These topics constitute the foundations for understanding how JavaScript works and starting to develop small programs and scripts.
