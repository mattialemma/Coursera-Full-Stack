In this part of the course, we started exploring the basics of JavaScript, performing tests both on Visual Studio Code and through the DevTools console of the Google Chrome browser.

## Topics Covered

The following were introduced and experimented with:

- Using `console.log` and the DevTools tool
- The fundamentals of conditional logic
- Switch structures
- Using variables
- The main loops (cycles)
- The fundamental syntax rules of the language

These topics constitute the foundations for understanding how JavaScript works and starting to develop small programs and scripts.
