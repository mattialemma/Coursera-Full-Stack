    Abstraction

    Abstraction consists of writing code in a way that makes it more generalized.

    Abstraction consists of extracting the concept of what you are trying to do, 
    rather than dealing with a specific manifestation of that concept.
    + You think about "what", not "how".
      e.g.: I want to cook.

    Encapsulation consists of not having access to or not worrying about
    the internal workings of some implementations.
    + You think about "how to use it", not "how it's made inside".
      e.g.: the oven works, but I don't know how it's made inside.
