// Encapsulation

/*
    In simple terms, encapsulation consists of making the implementation
    of a code "hidden" to other users, in the sense that they don't need
    to know how my code works to "consume" it.
*/

"abc".toUpperCase();

/*
    I don't worry about how toUpperCase works internally,
    the important thing is that it doesn't compromise my code.
