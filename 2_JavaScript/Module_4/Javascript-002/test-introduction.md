    -_-_-| E2E Testing () | -_-_-

    Tests the entire finished software product from the end user's perspective.


    -_-_-| Integration testing | -_-_-

    Tests how parts of the system interact with other parts of the system.
    In other words, they test how separate parts of the software interact with each other.
    They are faster and less expensive than E2E tests, but not as fast or economical as unit tests.


    -_-_-| Unit testing | -_-_-

    Unit testing is the process of testing the smallest units of source code in isolation.
    A good example is functions.
    A unit is the smallest piece of code that can be tested separately from the rest of the app.
    In practice, the smallest unit of testable code in JavaScript is usually a function or method.

    Unit tests are self-contained.
    They are designed to test code in isolation, preferably separate from the rest of the software.


    In Jest, mocking is used through Jest's mock functions.
