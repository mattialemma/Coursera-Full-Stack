Node.js is a standalone runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser, based on the V8 engine.
It includes npm (Node Package Manager), a package manager that allows you to install and use numerous libraries and frameworks in the form of modules.
An npm module is a piece of reusable code published in the npm registry, and is often also called an npm package.

The package.json file contains project information and the list of modules (dependencies) that the project uses, including those installed from the npm registry.

Examples of libraries that can be installed include React, Webpack, Bootstrap, and Angular Core.
The package.json file is updated when you install a new package.
