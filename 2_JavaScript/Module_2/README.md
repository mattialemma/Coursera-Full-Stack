## Overview

This document presents the fundamental concepts related to functions, arrays, and objects in JavaScript. Functions represent reusable blocks of code that allow you to organize and simplify the program. Arrays, while using dedicated syntax, are actually objects and offer specific methods and properties for managing ordered sets of values.

Strings, while sharing some superficial characteristics with arrays (such as indexing or the `length` property), are not arrays and exhibit different behaviors, particularly immutability.
It is therefore important to know the exceptions and differences between the various data types.

The Math object provides useful mathematical functions and constants, such as rounding operations, complex calculations, and random number generation.

Finally, exception and error handling allows you to intercept and handle anomalies during code execution, improving program stability and reliability.

## Practice

I completed guided and autonomous exercises to verify acquired skills, integrating some content with external resources to deepen aspects not covered in the course.
