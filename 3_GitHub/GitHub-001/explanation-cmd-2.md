# Command Explanation - Output Redirection

## Command Overview

```bash
ls -l /bin/usr > error_output.txt 2>&1
```

The command `ls -l /bin/usr > error_output.txt 2>&1` performs several operations:

---

## Command Breakdown

### `ls -l /bin/usr`

This command attempts to list files and directories in the `/bin/usr` folder in detailed format. However, `/bin/usr` is not a valid directory, so it will generate an error.

### `> error_output.txt`

This symbol redirects the standard output (i.e., the command results) to a file called `error_output.txt`. If the `ls` command had succeeded, the file list would have been written to this file.

### `2>&1`

This part of the command redirects the error output (which normally goes to the screen) to the same place as the standard output. In this case, it means that errors generated by the `ls` command will also be written to the `error_output.txt` file.

---

## Summary

In summary, if you run this command, the `error_output.txt` file will contain both the standard output (if there had been any) and any error messages. Since `/bin/usr` does not exist, you will find an error message in the file.

## Comparison

### Standard output + Error output

```bash
ls -l /bin/usr > error_output.txt 2>&1
```

In this command, both standard output and error output are written to the `error_output.txt` file.

### Error output only

```bash
ls -l /bin/usr 2> error.txt
```

In this command, only the error output is written to the `error.txt` file, while the standard output (if present) is displayed on the screen.
