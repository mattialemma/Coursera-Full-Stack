## 🔍 How Search Engines Analyze Web Pages

Search engines use automated programs, known as **crawlers** or **bots**, to scan web pages.

During this process, a search engine:

- Analyzes the **HTML code** of the page  
- Reads **textual and multimedia content**  
- Follows **links** to explore the rest of the website  
- Builds a **global representation** of the entire site  

Based on the collected information, search engines **index** web pages and **rank** them in search results.

> 📌 Rankings are not fixed: they may change depending on the **user query**, since each keyword is evaluated differently.

## 🏷️ Role of Meta Tags in SEO

**Meta tags** are HTML elements that provide **metadata**, meaning descriptive information about a web page.

Although they are not directly visible to users, meta tags are essential for both **search engines** and **browsers**.

Meta tags help search engines to:

- Understand the content of a page  
- Decide how it should be indexed  
- Determine how it should appear in search results

## 🧩 Common SEO Meta Tags

### `author`
Specifies the author of the content.

### `description`
Provides a short summary of the page.  
Often used as the **snippet** in search engine results.

### `keywords`
Lists relevant keywords for the content.  
> ⚠️ Today this tag has very limited SEO impact, but it remains conceptually important.

### `robots`
Instructs search engine crawlers on how to behave (e.g. index the page, follow links).

### `viewport`
Defines how the page should be rendered on mobile devices.

## 📱 Importance of the Viewport Meta Tag

The **viewport meta tag** is essential to ensure proper rendering on smartphones and tablets.

It allows:

- Layout adaptation to different screen sizes  
- Improved **mobile user experience**  
- Prevention of zoom and off-screen content issues  

Since modern search engines use a **mobile-first indexing** approach, mobile usability is a **key SEO ranking factor**.

> ❗ Pages that are not mobile-optimized may be penalized in search results.
