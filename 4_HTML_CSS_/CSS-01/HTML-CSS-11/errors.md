# Types of Errors

Mistakes are a natural part of programming, especially for beginners. Programming errors can be broadly classified into skill-based, rule-based, and knowledge-based errors.

## Skill-based Error

Happens during routine or automatic tasks due to slips or lapses. It is not about a lack of knowledge—just a momentary attention failure.

**Examples:**
- Typing the wrong key (typos).
- Forgetting to save a file.
- Missing brackets, quotation marks, or closing tags.
- Incorrect syntax.

These are common and can take time to debug, even though modern editors help flag many of them.

## Rule-based Error

Happens when a known rule or procedure is applied incorrectly, or the wrong rule is chosen. The person knows the rules but misuses them.

**Examples:**
- Following the right steps but in the wrong order.
- Naming conventions violations (e.g., class names starting with numbers).
- Confusion between similar CSS properties.
- Misusing layout methods (Flexbox vs Grid).

## Knowledge-based Error

Occurs when a person faces a new or unfamiliar situation and lacks sufficient knowledge. Decisions are made based on incomplete understanding.

**Examples:**
- Guessing how a new machine works and making a wrong decision.
- Using advanced code without fully understanding it.
- Writing overly complex selectors that are hard to maintain.

## Best Practices to Avoid Errors

To avoid these errors, developers should follow these best practices:

- **Use Shorthand Properties**: Simplify code and improve readability.
- **Understand Specificity**: Apply CSS specificity correctly to avoid misconfigurations and performance issues.
- **Avoid Over-Specificity**: Write broad, reusable rules instead.
- **Eliminate Redundancy**: Remove unused selectors and properties.
- **Use a CSS Reset**: Ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

By practicing regularly and following good coding practices, developers can reduce errors and write cleaner, more efficient code.
