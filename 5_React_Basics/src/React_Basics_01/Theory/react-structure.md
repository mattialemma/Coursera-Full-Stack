# Structure of a React Application

## node_modules
- This folder contains all the dependencies that are required for the project to run.
- It is not recommended to modify the contents of this folder.

## public
- This folder contains the public files that are required for the project to run, for example index.html, favicon.ico., images, etc.
Based on changes happening inside our React app, it injects those updates in that same div of index HTML.

## src
- This folder contains the source code of the project.

App.tsx is the main component of the project.
index.tsx is the entry point of the project.
index.css is the global styles of the project.
