I completed an introductory module on HTML5 and CSS.

## Introduction to HTML

I learned to describe the role of HTML in a web browser and to use HTML tags with correct syntax.

I am able to outline the structure of an HTML page, build basic HTML documents, and create links between documents using the `href` attribute.

## Document Object Model (DOM)

I explored the DOM, understanding its function and how it is generated from an HTML page.

I learned how programmers interact with the DOM through JavaScript to update content and handle events.

## Web Accessibility and CSS

I acquired knowledge about web accessibility and assistive technologies, as well as techniques to improve the accessibility of my projects.

Finally, I started studying CSS, learning to write rules to style HTML elements and understand the box model.
