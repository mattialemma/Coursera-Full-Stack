# Module 2

This project collects and combines the basic knowledge learned in Module 1 and the first part of Module 2, up to the section "Text and Color in CSS".
The goal is to practice the main HTML elements and fundamental CSS rules.

Inside the style.css file, there are examples of different types of CSS selectors, with various tests on text properties, colors, and structure.

In the index.html file, practical tests were performed on selectors and the main HTML elements covered in the modules, such as paragraphs, forms, images, headings, lists, links, and other basic tags.
