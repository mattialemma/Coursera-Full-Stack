# Module 2

Introduction to span and div to understand inline and block in HTML, centering an element and text.

- BLOCK
Block elements in HTML include all those that occupy the entire width and push subsequent content to a new line: we're talking about `<div>`, paragraphs `<p>`, headings from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, and semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. Also block are `<address>`, `<blockquote>`, `<pre>`, the horizontal line `<hr>`, forms `<form>`, lists `<ul>` and `<ol>` with their `<li>`, all table parts like `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>` and `<tr>`, plus `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`. All these elements always create a new "visual block".

- INLINE
Inline elements, instead, remain on the same line and occupy only the necessary space. In this category are `<span>`, links `<a>`, formatting like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<small>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<mark>`, `<cite>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, `<var>`, `<abbr>`, `<time>` and `<q>`. Also inline are images `<img>`, line breaks `<br>`, and various form elements like `<label>` and some controls that behave as inline-block, like `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` and `<button>`. Also `<svg>` is inline by default.

In summary: block elements build the vertical structure of the page because they occupy the full width and go to a new line, while inline elements behave like text, stay on the same line and are used for smaller portions of content.

To center a block element, use margin: auto; with a defined width. To center text, use text-align: center;.
