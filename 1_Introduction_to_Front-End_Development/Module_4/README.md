In this part of the course, I performed several practical tests using Bootstrap, with the goal of understanding and applying the fundamental components and classes of the framework.

## What I Practiced

The following were put into practice:

- Using the grid system to create responsive layouts
- Using containers, rows, and cols
- Customization through utility classes (spacing, colors, display, etc.)
- Integration of components like navbar, card, button, form
- Basic principles of responsive design

These tests allowed me to become familiar with Bootstrap's modular structure and with the rapid creation of modern interfaces adaptable to various devices.
